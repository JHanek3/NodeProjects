# Node Portfolio-Page
https://haneknode.herokuapp.com/

## Explanation

This is the repo for all of my Node projects. Right now there are 6 of them. The repo and website are better organized then my previous one, so it should be easier to navigate

If you want to find my frontend repos, they are titled VuePortfolioPage and ReactPortfolioPage

##  Future Projects
Out of Laziness, all of my project links going forward will be found https://hanekvue.herokuapp.com/projects like my Node backend work. I did this because I prefer Vuex syntax over Redux sytax.

## TL:DR
Repo for Vue apps, click on my other Repos for React and Node.
